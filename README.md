# Opinionated Python
Inspired by awesome-python this list tries to reduce the number of possible options to single tools for a given purpose.

## Important PEPs
* [PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518) defines pyproject.toml as a configuration file to store build system requirements for Python projects.

## Dependency Management
[poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry) seems like a reasonable choice for dependency managment which is easy to install, understand and use. Uses pyproject.toml as defined in [PEP 518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518)
